It all looks great. Awesome Job!!. Next I would like to persist data. 1) Make a database service, MongoDB. We already have dockerized mongo. Make a database repository for the frontend to interact with. 2) Class disign entities we're going to persists. We're going to need at least the following models; Retailer, Product, Flow, UserProfile. 

Here's what the models should look like, you can add more fields as needed.

Product:
manufacturerId 
description
price
interalId 

Retailer:
id : uuid
name
url 
internalId
zipcode

Flow
id
retailer 
steps


UserProfile:
id 
shippingAddress
billingAddress
phoneNumber
paymentMethod. 

We'll so need to a service for proxies. This service is between the backend and retailers's endpoint.
