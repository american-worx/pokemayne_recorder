# Project Brief: Pokemayne Recorder

## Project Overview
Pokemayne Recorder is an advanced e-commerce checkout automation tool designed to capture and execute checkout flows for various online retailers. The tool uses Playwright-Extra with stealth capabilities to bypass anti-bot detection systems while maintaining human-like behavior patterns.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Functionality
1. **Flow Capture**: Analyze and record e-commerce checkout processes from product page to order confirmation
2. **Flow Execution**: Automate checkout processes with configurable parameters (size, payment, shipping)
3. **Anti-Detection**: Implement stealth techniques to bypass bot detection systems (Akamai, PerimeterX, DataDome)
4. **Multi-Site Support**: Modular architecture supporting different e-commerce platforms (Nike, Shopify, etc.)

### Technical Requirements
- Node.js v18+ runtime environment
- Playwright-Extra with Puppeteer-Extra-Plugin-Stealth integration
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Proxy rotation and user-agent randomization
- Human-like timing and interaction patterns
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Logging and monitoring capabilities

### Architecture Requirements
- **Core Engine**: Centralized browser management and common utilities
- **Recorder Engine**: Record all actions and network details for flow cloning
- **Site Modules**: Platform-specific checkout implementations
- **Configuration System**: YAML/JSON-based flow definitions
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line execution with parameter support
- **Testing Framework**: E2E test coverage for checkout flows

## Success Criteria
- Successfully record checkout flows for target e-commerce sites
- Successfully automate checkout flows for target e-commerce sites
- Maintain stealth capabilities against current bot detection systems
- Support concurrent execution with proxy rotation
- Provide reliable error recovery and logging
- Enable easy addition of new site support

## Scope Limitations
- Legal compliance: Tool for educational/research purposes only
- No malicious intent or unauthorized access
- Respect for website terms of service
- Focus on legitimate automation use cases

## Key Deliverables
1. Functional checkout automation engine
2. Site-specific module implementations
3. Comprehensive documentation and examples
4. Testing suite for validation
5. Configuration templates for common sites
