# Phase 1 Summary: Core Infrastructure Setup

## Overview
Phase 1 of the Pokemayne Recorder project focused on establishing the core infrastructure needed for the automation tool. This included setting up the project structure, configuring development tools, implementing basic components, and establishing a testing framework.

## Completed Tasks

### Project Structure
- Created standard directory structure:
  - `src/` - Source code
  - `config/` - Configuration files
  - `modules/` - Site-specific modules
  - `tests/` - Unit and integration tests
  - `logs/` - Application logs
  - `memory-bank/` - Documentation and context (already existed)
  - `memory-bank/plans/` - Implementation plans

### Dependency Management
- Created `package.json` with all required dependencies:
  - **Core**: playwright, playwright-extra, puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth
  - **Utilities**: winston (logging), yargs (CLI), js-yaml (configuration), axios (HTTP), cheerio (parsing), uuid (identifiers), dotenv (environment)
  - **Development**: @playwright/test, jest (testing), eslint/prettier (code quality), nodemon (development)

### Development Tools
- Configured ESLint with standard JavaScript rules
- Set up Prettier for code formatting
- Created Jest configuration for testing
- Implemented `.gitignore` for proper version control
- Created `.env.example` for environment variable management

### Core Application
- Implemented `src/index.js` as the main entry point
- Created CLI interface using yargs with commands:
  - `record` - Record checkout flows
  - `execute` - Execute recorded flows
  - `list-sites` - List supported sites
- Added Winston logging with file and console transports

### Core Components
- **BrowserManager**: Manages browser instances with stealth capabilities
- **ConfigurationManager**: Handles YAML/JSON configuration loading and validation
- **FlowExecutor**: Executes recorded checkout flows
- **SiteModuleFactory**: Creates site-specific module instances

### Testing Framework
- Configured Jest testing framework
- Created unit tests for all core components:
  - BrowserManager tests
  - ConfigurationManager tests
  - FlowExecutor tests
  - SiteModuleFactory tests
- Achieved >70% test coverage for core components

### Documentation
- Updated `README.md` with project overview and usage instructions
- Created implementation plan for Phase 2
- Updated `tasks.md` to mark Phase 1 as complete
- Updated `progress.md` to reflect current status
- Updated `activeContext.md` with current focus

## Key Achievements
1. **Fully functional development environment** with all necessary tools and dependencies
2. **Modular architecture** with clearly defined components
3. **Comprehensive testing framework** with unit tests for all core functionality
4. **Working CLI interface** with basic command support
5. **Proper logging system** with both console and file output
6. **Configuration management** with support for both YAML and JSON formats

## Technical Foundation
The infrastructure established in Phase 1 provides a solid foundation for the core engine development in Phase 2. Key technical decisions include:

- **Node.js platform** for JavaScript-based automation
- **Playwright-Extra with Stealth Plugin** for browser automation and anti-detection
- **Modular component design** for maintainability and extensibility
- **YAML/JSON configuration** for flexible flow definitions
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging and monitoring
- **Unit testing framework** for quality assurance

## Next Steps
With Phase 1 complete, the project is well-positioned to move into Phase 2: Core Engine Development. The next phase will focus on enhancing the core components with full stealth capabilities, implementing the recorder engine, and adding advanced features like error handling and retry mechanisms.

## Challenges Addressed
- **Tool Integration**: Successfully configured multiple development tools to work together
- **Dependency Management**: Resolved all dependency conflicts and ensured compatibility
- **Testing Setup**: Created a robust testing environment with good coverage
- **Code Quality**: Implemented linting and formatting for consistent code style

## Lessons Learned
1. **Incremental Setup**: Building the infrastructure in phases helps identify and resolve issues early
2. **Testing First**: Implementing tests alongside core components ensures quality from the start
3. **Modular Design**: Breaking functionality into separate components improves maintainability
4. **Documentation**: Keeping documentation updated helps maintain context and direction
