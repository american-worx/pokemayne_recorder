# Phase 3 Implementation Plan: CLI Interface & User Experience

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of the CLI interface and user experience enhancements for the Pokemayne Recorder project. The focus is on creating a robust command-line interface, enhancing the logging system, and implementing progress monitoring features.

## Components to Implement

### 1. Command-Line Interface
The CLI will be enhanced with more sophisticated argument parsing, better help documentation, and improved user experience.

#### Tasks:
- [x] Implement advanced yargs for argument parsing
  - Add validation for required arguments
  - Implement custom argument types
  - Add argument dependencies and conflicts
- [x] Add site selection options
  - Implement site-specific validation
  - Add autocomplete for site names
  - Create site aliases
- [x] Create configuration file loading
  - Implement multiple configuration formats (YAML, JSON)
  - Add configuration validation
  - Implement configuration merging
- [x] Implement help and usage documentation
  - Create detailed command help
  - Add examples for each command
  - Implement interactive help system

### 2. Logging System
The logging system will be enhanced with file rotation, structured logging, and different log levels.

#### Tasks:
- [x] Set up Winston logger configuration
  - Configure multiple transports
  - Implement log level filtering
  - Add custom log formats
- [x] Implement structured logging
  - Add context to log messages
  - Implement consistent log message formats
  - Add metadata to log entries
- [x] Add log file rotation
  - Implement size-based rotation
  - Add time-based rotation
  - Configure retention policies
- [x] Create different log levels (debug, info, error)
  - Implement level-based filtering
  - Add level-specific formatting
  - Configure level-specific transports

### 3. Progress Monitoring
Progress monitoring will provide real-time feedback during long-running operations.

#### Tasks:
- [x] Add real-time progress indicators
  - Implement progress bars
  - Add status messages
  - Create spinner animations
- [x] Implement execution time tracking
  - Add start/stop timers
  - Implement duration tracking
  - Add time estimates
- [x] Create success/failure statistics
  - Implement counters
  - Add rate calculations
  - Create summary reports
- [x] Add performance metrics collection
  - Implement metric collection
  - Add metric aggregation
  - Create metric reporting

## Implementation Approach

### Week 1: CLI Enhancement and Logging
- Enhance CLI with advanced argument parsing
- Implement configuration file loading
- Enhance logging system with file rotation
- Add structured logging

### Week 2: Progress Monitoring and User Experience
- Implement real-time progress indicators
- Add execution time tracking
- Create success/failure statistics
- Implement performance metrics collection

### Week 3: Testing and Refinement
- Write unit tests for CLI components
- Perform integration testing
- Refine user experience
- Optimize performance

### Week 4: Documentation and Examples
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Add usage examples
- Implement interactive help
- Create user guides

## Dependencies
- yargs (CLI argument parsing)
- winston (logging)
- cli-progress (progress indicators)
- dotenv (environment variables)
- js-yaml (YAML parsing)

## Success Criteria
- All CLI commands fully functional with proper argument validation
- Logging system with file rotation and structured logging
- Real-time progress monitoring during operations
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- All unit tests passing
- Code coverage > 85%

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for CLI argument parsing
- Integration tests for logging system
- End-to-end tests for progress monitoring
- Performance benchmarks for CLI operations
- User experience testing with sample commands

## Risks and Mitigation
- **CLI Complexity**: Keep commands simple and well-documented
- **Logging Performance**: Use asynchronous logging to avoid blocking
- **Progress Accuracy**: Implement accurate progress calculation
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Test on multiple operating systems
