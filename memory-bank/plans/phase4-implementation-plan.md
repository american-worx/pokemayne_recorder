# Phase 4 Implementation Plan: Base Module Framework

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of the base module framework for the Pokemayne Recorder project. The focus is on creating an abstract base module class, implementing a site factory pattern, and developing common utilities that will be shared across all site-specific modules.

## Components to Implement

### 1. Abstract Base Module
Create a robust base module class that all site-specific modules will extend, providing common functionality and interfaces.

#### Tasks:
- [x] Create BaseSiteModule class with core functionality
- [x] Implement common checkout methods (initialize, executeCheckout, recordFlow)
- [x] Add CAPTCHA detection interface
- [x] Create error handling templates
- [x] Implement configuration management
- [x] Add logging capabilities
- [x] Create browser context management

### 2. Site Factory Pattern
Implement a dynamic module loading system that can discover, validate, and instantiate site-specific modules.

#### Tasks:
- [x] Implement dynamic module loading from file system
- [x] Add module discovery system with automatic scanning
- [x] Create module validation and compatibility checking
- [x] Implement fallback mechanisms for missing modules
- [x] Add module caching for performance
- [x] Create module registration interface

### 3. Common Utilities
Develop reusable utility functions that will be used across all site modules to ensure consistency and reduce code duplication.

#### Tasks:
- [x] Implement human-like delay functions with randomization
- [x] Add selector stability checking with retry mechanisms
- [x] Create form filling utilities with error handling
- [x] Implement wait strategy helpers with multiple approaches
- [x] Add network monitoring utilities
- [x] Create screenshot and debugging utilities
- [x] Implement retry and backoff mechanisms

## Implementation Approach

### Week 1: Abstract Base Module
- Design and implement BaseSiteModule class
- Create common checkout method interfaces
- Implement CAPTCHA detection and handling interfaces
- Add error handling templates
- Implement configuration management

### Week 2: Site Factory Pattern
- Implement dynamic module loading system
- Create module discovery and validation
- Add module caching and registration
- Implement fallback mechanisms
- Test with various module scenarios

### Week 3: Common Utilities
- Implement human-like delay functions
- Create selector stability checking
- Develop form filling utilities
- Implement wait strategy helpers
- Add network monitoring utilities
- Create debugging utilities

### Week 4: Testing and Refinement
- Write unit tests for all components
- Perform integration testing
- Refine interfaces based on testing
- Optimize performance
- Update documentation

## Dependencies
- Playwright/Puppeteer for browser automation
- Winston for logging
- Path module for file system operations
- EventEmitter for event handling
- Built-in Node.js modules (fs, path, etc.)

## Success Criteria
- BaseSiteModule class with all core functionality
- Site factory pattern with dynamic loading
- Comprehensive set of common utilities
- All unit tests passing
- Code coverage > 85%
- Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Modular and extensible design

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for BaseSiteModule methods
- Integration tests for SiteModuleFactory
- Testing of common utilities with various scenarios
- Performance benchmarks for module loading
- Compatibility testing with different module types
- Error handling and recovery testing

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Module Loading Complexity**: Keep the factory pattern simple and well-documented
- **Performance Issues**: Implement caching and optimize file system operations
- **Compatibility Problems**: Use interfaces and validation to ensure module compatibility
- **Extensibility Limitations**: Design with inheritance and composition in mind
