- Optimize performance

## Dependencies
- Playwright-Extra
- Puppeteer-Extra-Plugin-Stealth
- Winston (logging)
- js-yaml (YAML parsing)
- axios (HTTP requests)

## Success Criteria
- All core components implemented and tested
- BrowserManager successfully launches stealth browsers
- FlowExecutor can run basic flows
- ConfigurationManager handles configurations properly
- Error handling system works correctly
- All unit tests passing
- Code coverage > 80%

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete flows
- Performance benchmarks
- Security testing for sensitive data handling

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Stealth Plugin Compatibility**: Test with different Playwright versions
- **Browser Resource Management**: Implement proper cleanup procedures
- **Configuration Complexity**: Provide clear documentation and examples
- **Error Recovery**: Implement comprehensive error categorization
