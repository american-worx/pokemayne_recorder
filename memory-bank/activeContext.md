# Active Context: Pokemayne Recorder

## Current Work Focus

### Immediate Priority: CLI Interface & User Experience
The project has successfully completed the core engine development phase. We are now focused on enhancing the CLI interface and user experience, including advanced argument parsing, logging, and progress monitoring.

## Current State

### Project Status
- **Phase**: CLI Interface & User Experience
- **Readiness**: Core engine complete, CLI enhancements in progress
- **Next Milestone**: Complete CLI interface and begin base module framework

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Technology Stack**: Node.js + Playwright-Extra + Stealth Plugin
2. **Architecture**: Modular design with core engine + site-specific modules
3. **Approach**: Two-phase (Capture â†’ Execute) workflow
4. **Documentation**: Memory bank structure following established patterns
5. **Testing**: Jest unit testing framework with >85% coverage

### Implementation Priorities
1. **CLI Interface**: Enhanced argument parsing and command handling
2. **Logging System**: Advanced logging with file rotation
3. **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time progress indicators
4. **Base Module Structure**: Template for site-specific implementations

## Active Considerations

### Technical Decisions Pending
1. **CLI Design**: Finalizing command structure and options
2. **Logging Strategy**: Determining log levels and output formats
3. **Progress Reporting**: Designing user-friendly progress indicators
4. **Configuration Management**: Finalizing environment variable naming conventions

### Implementation Priorities
1. **CLI Enhancement**: Advanced argument parsing and help system
2. **Logging System**: Structured logging with rotation
3. **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time execution tracking
4. **Base Module Framework**: Abstract base module and factory pattern

## Recent Changes
- **Core Engine Completion**: Implemented BrowserManager, FlowExecutor, ConfigurationManager, RecorderEngine, ErrorHandling
- **Enhanced Stealth**: Added advanced fingerprint randomization and evasion techniques
- **Robust Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error recovery with retry mechanisms
- **Recording Capabilities**: Created full recording engine for capturing user actions
- **Testing**: Added comprehensive unit tests (32/32 passing)
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated progress.md and tasks.md to reflect current status

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. **CLI Enhancement**: Implement advanced argument parsing with yargs
2. **Logging System**: Enhance Winston logging with file rotation
3. **Progress Monitoring**: Add real-time progress indicators
4. **Help Documentation**: Implement comprehensive help and usage documentation

### Short Term (Next 1-2 Sessions)
1. **Base Module Framework**: Create abstract BaseSiteModule class
2. **Site Factory Pattern**: Implement dynamic module loading
3. **Common Utilities**: Add human-like delay functions and utilities
4. **Integration Testing**: Test CLI with core engine components

### Medium Term (Next Week)
1. **Site Modules**: Implement demo site checkout (SauceDemo)
2. **Advanced Features**: Add proxy management and CAPTCHA handling
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement execution time tracking
4. **User Experience**: Enhance progress reporting and statistics

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Style
- **Async/Await**: Preferred over Promises for readability
- **ES6+ Features**: Utilize modern JavaScript features
- **Modular Design**: Keep functions focused and reusable
- **Error First**: Handle errors explicitly at each level

### Development Workflow
- **Testing First**: Write tests before implementation
- **Documentation**: Update memory bank with significant changes
- **Version Control**: Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- **Code Review**: Self-review before committing complex changes

## Current Challenges
1. **CLI Design**: Creating intuitive command structure and options
2. **Logging Strategy**: Balancing verbosity with useful information
3. **Progress Reporting**: Designing meaningful progress indicators
4. **Error Recovery**: Ensuring graceful handling of all error conditions

## Learnings & Insights

### Technical Insights
- Advanced stealth techniques significantly improve automation success rates
- Comprehensive error handling with retry mechanisms is essential for reliability
- Environment variable overrides provide flexible configuration management
- Recording capabilities enable powerful flow creation and analysis

### Project Insights
- Modular architecture enables easy extension and maintenance

## Active Questions
1. Should we implement a web-based dashboard in addition to CLI?
2. What level of detail should we include in progress reporting?
3. How should we structure the configuration for different checkout scenarios?
4. What additional logging information would be most useful for debugging?
