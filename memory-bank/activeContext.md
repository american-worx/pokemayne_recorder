# Active Context: Pokemayne Recorder

## Current Work Focus

### Immediate Priority: Project Foundation
The project is in its initial setup phase with memory bank documentation being established. The core concept is defined but no implementation has begun yet.

## Current State

### Project Status
- **Phase**: Planning and Documentation
- **Readiness**: Memory bank structure created, requirements documented
- **Next Milestone**: Begin core implementation

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Technology Stack**: Node.js + Playwright-Extra + Stealth Plugin
2. **Architecture**: Modular design with core engine + site-specific modules
3. **Approach**: Two-phase (Capture → Execute) workflow
4. **Documentation**: Memory bank structure following established patterns

## Active Considerations

### Technical Decisions Pending
1. **Project Structure**: Finalize directory layout for src/, config/, modules/
2. **Configuration Format**: Choose between YAML and JSON for flow definitions
3. **Logging Strategy**: Select logging framework (winston vs. built-in console)
4. **Error Handling**: Define retry strategies and failure recovery patterns

### Implementation Priorities
1. **Core Engine**: Browser management and stealth setup
2. **Recorder Engine**: Record all actions and key network details
3. **Base Module Structure**: Template for site-specific implementations
4. **Configuration System**: Flow definition parsing and validation
5. **CLI Interface**: Command-line argument handling

## Recent Changes
- **Memory Bank Creation**: Created complete documentation structure
- **Project Brief**: Defined core requirements and scope
- **Product Context**: Documented purpose and target use cases
- **Site Modules Added**: Created comprehensive modules for Walmart, Target, and BestBuy
- **Site-Specific Documentation**: Added detailed checkout flows, anti-bot strategies, and implementation guides

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. **Complete Memory Bank**: Finish systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md
2. **Project Structure**: Create initial directory layout
3. **Dependencies**: Set up package.json with required modules

### Short Term (Next 1-2 Sessions)
1. **Core Implementation**: Build browser launch and stealth setup
1.5 **Recorder Implementation**: Build a stealth recorder to capture clicks, click location and network details. 
2. **Basic Flow Engine**: Implement simple checkout flow execution
3. **Test Site Integration**: Add support for a demo e-commerce site
4. **Configuration System**: Implement YAML/JSON flow parsing

### Medium Term (Next Week)
1. **Site Modules**: Implement Nike and Shopify checkout modules
2. **Advanced Stealth**: Add fingerprint randomization and human patterns
3. **Proxy Support**: Implement proxy rotation and management
4. **Error Recovery**: Build comprehensive retry and fallback mechanisms

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Style
- **Async/Await**: Preferred over Promises for readability
- **ES6+ Features**: Utilize modern JavaScript features
- **Modular Design**: Keep functions focused and reusable
- **Error First**: Handle errors explicitly at each level

### Development Workflow
- **Testing First**: Write tests before implementation
- **Documentation**: Update memory bank with significant changes
- **Version Control**: Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- **Code Review**: Self-review before committing complex changes

## Current Challenges
1. **Stealth Plugin Adaptation**: Adapting puppeteer-stealth for playwright-extra
2. **Selector Stability**: Ensuring selectors work across site updates
3. **Rate Limiting**: Balancing speed with detection avoidance
4. **Memory Management**: Efficient browser instance lifecycle

## Learnings & Insights

### Technical Insights
- Playwright-Extra provides excellent foundation for stealth automation
- Two-phase approach (capture → execute) is essential for complex flows
- Human-like timing is crucial for bypassing detection
- Modular architecture enables easy platform expansion

### Project Insights
- Comprehensive documentation is critical for complex automation projects
- Memory bank structure provides excellent context continuity
- Ethical considerations must be built into the design from the start
- Testing infrastructure is as important as the core functionality

## Active Questions
1. Should we implement a web-based dashboard or stick to CLI-only?
2. What's the best approach for handling CAPTCHA challenges?
3. How should we structure the configuration for different checkout scenarios?
4. What's the optimal balance between stealth and performance?
