## Known Issues & Blockers

### Technical Challenges
1. **Stealth Plugin Compatibility**: Need to verify puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth works with playwright-extra
2. **Browser Resource Management**: Ensuring efficient browser instance lifecycle management
3. **Selector Reliability**: Handling dynamic selectors that change with site updates
4. **Rate Limiting Detection**: Balancing speed with detection avoidance

### Development Challenges
1. **Testing Environment**: Need safe test sites that don't violate terms of service
2. **Legal Compliance**: Ensuring all usage remains within ethical boundaries
3. **Performance Optimization**: Managing memory usage with multiple browser instances
4. **Error Recovery**: Designing robust fallback mechanisms for various failure scenarios

### External Dependencies
1. **Proxy Services**: Reliable proxy rotation service for IP management
2. **CAPTCHA Solving**: Integration with CAPTCHA solving APIs if needed
3. **Site Monitoring**: Tools to detect when selectors break due to site changes

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Initial Decision**: Monolithic architecture → **Evolved to**: Modular architecture with core engine + site modules
- **Rationale**: Better maintainability and extensibility for multiple e-commerce platforms

### Technology Choices
- **Browser Automation**: Selenium → Playwright → Playwright-Extra with Stealth
- **Rationale**: Better API, cross-browser support, and stealth capabilities

### Development Approach
- **Initial Plan**: Build all features simultaneously → **Current**: Phased approach with working core first
- **Rationale**: Faster time-to-working-solution and better risk management

### Scope Adjustments
- **Expanded**: Added comprehensive documentation and memory bank system
- **Constrained**: Focused on core checkout automation before advanced features
- **Rationale**: Better project management and clearer success criteria

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Modular Design**: Easy to update site-specific modules when changes occur
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Regular testing against target sites
3. **Ethical Guidelines**: Built-in compliance checks and usage limitations
4. **Monitoring**: Automated detection of site changes and selector failures
